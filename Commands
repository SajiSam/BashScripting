EXERCISE-1

Part A
-List the content of your Home Folder

Solution:
ls
-List all the content of  folders that strts with "D" (capital)
( if you don't have any, choose another letter )

ls "D*"

-Create a file "info.txt"  in your present working directory.

Solution:
touch info.txt

-Inside "info-txt" write the long list information about

EXERCISE-2

Part A
-Create a file "hello.txt"  in your present working directory.
-Rename it as "hello .sh"
-Make this file executable only by the owner

Solution:

touch hello.txt
mv hello.txt hello.sh
chmod u=rwx hello.sh

Part B
-Read from imput a name of a file (invented by who is typing )and save it inside a variable
-Create a file with that name using the variable 

Solution:

read -p "Input a filename:" name

Input a filename: qwe

-Create a file with that name and the prefix "1_" attached in front of it
touch 1_$name

Part C 

In this Exercise we  focus on the difference between variable expansion and command substitution.
Let's say that we want to record the exact time when we did something in the terminal.

-Store the actual date and time using a variabe "important_time" and check it

Solution: echo $important_time 
Fri 2 Jan 2026 09:23:18 GMT


 echo $important_time
Fri 2 Jan 2026 09:23:18 GMT         //The shell performs word splitting on spaces and tabs. Multiple spaces collapse into one because echo sees separate arguments. Single space between words.
 echo "${important_time}"
Fri  2 Jan 2026 09:23:18 GMT       //Quoting preserves the exact string, including those extra spaces. There are two spaces before the day if it’s a single digit, because date uses fixed-width formatting.

-Create a Variable "dd"  that execute the command "date". and check it
echo $dd
Fri 2 Jan 2026 09:23:58 GMT

What is the difference between $imp_date  and   $dd  ?

The difference between $imp_date (which likely holds a static value) and $dd (which is dynamically executed each time it is accessed) lies in how they store and retrieve information.

$imp_date: This variable stores the result of executing the command date at the time it was set. Once you assign it, it holds that specific date and time, which does not change unless you explicitly update it by reassigning.

$dd: In contrast, this variable executes the command date every time it's accessed. Therefore, if you access $dd at different times, you will get the current date and time each time, reflecting the moment of the access.
